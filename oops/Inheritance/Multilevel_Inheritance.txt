
Multilevel Inheritance in Python
Till now, all the examples we have seen involve one class inheriting from another. However, Python allows us to have more than one level of inheritance.

We could have the following structure:

When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent classes, such inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.

This is how the above class diagram would look in Python:

class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lives = 5
        self.speed = 0
        self.stamina = 10
    def run(self):
        self.speed = self.speed + 5
 
 
class Warrior(Player):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__() # initializing all values of parent class
        self.strength = 100
 
class Archer(Warrior):
    def shoot(self):
        # definition for shoot
 
class Knight(Warrior):
    def fight(self):
        # definition for fight
