Traversal
Before trees, all of the data structures we have seen are linear in nature. What that meant was that there was only one way of going through the data structure: linearly.

In a linked list, we can start from first and keep going till we reach the end.

However, what about a tree? How will we go through each element?

Take the example of the following tree:

Tree

How will we display all the elements? In what order?

In trees, thereare many ways in which we can traverse. Let us look at one way called the preorder traversal.

Preorder Traversal
In Preorder Traversal, we do the following steps at each node:

we print the current node
we visit the left subtree
we visit the right subtree
Tree

So, for the following tree:

Tree

Our Preorder Traversal is:

7, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 12, 9, 8, 11, 19, 15, 20
The pesudo-code for the traversal is:

preorder (node x)
    if x == null
        return
    else
        print x.data
        preorder(x.left)
        preorder(x.right)
As you can see, we have used recursion to help us with the traversal. As you attempt more programs, you will notice that recursion is very useful when it comes to trees.
