Postorder Traversal (A)
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.

Note: Using recursion is not allowed.
Example :
Input :
Given binary tree

1
 \
  2
 /
3
The input is presented as:
1 -1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 (here -1 represents null)

Please note that the above is only a representation of the input. In the answer, please use the head node to traverse through the tree

Output :
[3, 2, 1]
